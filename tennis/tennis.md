# Sick Tammy's One Set Tennis

Tammy really likes one-set tennis, because the scoring system is rather simple:

- Each player can have either of these points in one game “0” “15” “30” “40”.
- If you have 40 and you win the point you win the set, however there are special rules.
- If both have 40 the players are “deuce”.
- If the game is in deuce, the winner of a point will have advantage.
- If the player with advantage wins the ball he wins the game.
- If the player without advantage wins they are back at deuce.

She hired Bobby to make a program announcing the score after each ball.
Bobby developped the program and even made a Unit Test for it !
However, Tammy found that it was bugged.
She wrote more tests but she's sick and cannot do the implementation. There you go !
