# Food truck

Kat's food truck started quick and dirty.
It can do recipes by getting ingredients from a fridge.
After collecting customer feedback, Kat wants to make new recipes with other ingredients.
She bought a shelf to store them, and she does not want to alter it (do not modify code in the forbidden package).

Help Kat make better recipes by integrating the shelf in her food truck with the adapter pattern.
