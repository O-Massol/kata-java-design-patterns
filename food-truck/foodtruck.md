# Food truck
Pat's food truck started quick and dirty.
It can do pizzas and paninis.
After collecting customer feedback, Pat's know that some features could help him in the long run.
Pat knows that his DIY system is lacking proper testing and structure, he wants continuous improvement when adding a feature.
One thing though : the name of the food should be representative of it !

Depending on the time you have, choose one or more of the features and implement them.
- Being able to make Burgers with or without bacon at 12.5$
- Being able to take multiple orders in one go
- Being able to add (or not) mushrooms on any pizza
- Being able to make vegetarian pizza at 11$
- Being able to add chicken (or not) on a Hawaiian pizza
- Price any burger or panini at 10$, and add 2$ for each extra (this supercedes other prices indications)
- Price any pizza at 11$, add 1$ if it's not a Margharita pizza, and add 2$ for each extra (this supercedes other prices indications)
- Being able to sell meal-combos with a food, a beverage and a desert (a meal combo costs 2.5$ more thant its food)
